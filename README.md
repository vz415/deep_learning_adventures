tutorials and fun with deep learning

This is a repository of tutorials in deep learning, ranging from creating a basic neural network in numpy to more advanced topics, such as CNNs and RNNs. Some of the data has been removed due to size constraints. If that's the case, I will provide a link where you can download the data.

Most of this material comes from Udacity sources (praise their tutorials), but I'll do my best to convey information through these notebooks.
