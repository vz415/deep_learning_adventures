# deep_learning_adventures
Tutorials and fun with deep learning. *This repository was mainly used with an AWS EC2 instance and has information missing. I will be releasing blog posts on these projects in due time, allowing me to clean up outputs and focus on unique deep learning questions.*

This is a repository of tutorials in deep learning, ranging from creating a basic neural network in numpy to more advanced topics, such as CNNs and RNNs. Some of the data has been removed due to size constraints. If that's the case, I will provide a link where you can download the data.

Most of this material comes from Udacity sources (praise their tutorials), but I'll do my best to convey information through these notebooks.
